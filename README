Linux::KernelSort version 0.01
==============================

Linux::KernelSort is intended to sort a list of kernel versions into
ascending order.  It also provides the capability to compare
two kernel versions and determine if one version is newer, older,
or the same as the other version.  NOTE:  Currently only the
2.6.x kernel series (including -rc's, -git's, and -mm's) are
properly evaluated.
